## Dedication
This project is dedicated to a very special skater, MS. 

During a really rough time in the world, and especially in my mental health, she was and continues to be a shining beacon of hope. Her kind soul, infectious smile, and un-paralleled talent inspires me every day. I could only wish to contribute a fraction of the positive energy that she has given the skating community.
